### 3. **SMC Pentax-A 35–105mm f/3.5 (“stack of primes”)**
- **Era:** mid–1980s  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Outstanding sharpness and consistency across range.  
  - Lovely rendering, often compared to carrying multiple primes.  
  - Constant f/3.5 aperture.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Heavy, bulky.  
  - Minimum focus distance is long (not great for close-up work).  
- **Best For:** Landscape, architecture, general-purpose photography where quality is top priority.  

---

### 4. **SMC Pentax-A 70–210mm f/4**
- **Era:** mid–1980s

  - Constant f/4 aperture.  
  - Sharp, good contrast, reliable.  
  - Better optical quality than earlier Pentax tele-zooms.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Large, not very discreet.  
  - Outclassed by modern telephotos for sharpness and flare control.  
- **Best For:** Wildlife, sports, compressed landscapes.

- **Strengths:**  
  - Unusually fast aperture (f/2.8 at the wide end).  
  - Interesting as an early “fast” standard zoom.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Large, heavy, with mixed optical performance.  
  - Flare-prone, soft edges, variable sharpness across zoom range.  
- **Best For:** Collectors, experimenters looking for character rather than precision.

## Zooms vs Primes (28/35/50/85/135mm)

You already have a strong prime set: **28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, 135mm (SMC Pentax)**.  
Here’s how the zooms overlap:

- **28–50mm** → Replaces 28mm + 35mm primes in convenience, but not in speed/sharpness.  
- **35–70mm (Pentax & Zeiss variants)** → Overlaps 35mm + 50mm primes; good everyday lens, but lacks reach.  
- **A 35–105mm** → Effectively covers 35/50/85 primes; closest to a “prime replacement.”  
- **M 75–150mm** → Bridges 85mm + 135mm primes; compact alternative to carrying both.  
- **A 70–210mm** → Extends beyond your 135mm, complements but does not replace it.  
- **40–80mm** → Awkward range and weaker optics; not a tru
