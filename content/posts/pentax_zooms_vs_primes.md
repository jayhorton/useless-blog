## 🔍 Comparison: Zooms vs Primes (28/35/50/85/135mm)

You already have a strong prime set: **28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, 135mm** (SMC Pentax).  
Here’s how the zooms compare:

- **35–70mm f/2.8–3.5**  
  - Covers 35mm, 50mm, and 70mm → partially overlaps your 35mm and 50mm primes.  
  - **Not a replacement** for your 28mm (wider) or 85mm (faster portrait lens).  
  - **Use as a convenience lens** when you want to travel light and don’t need ultimate sharpness.  

- **M 75–150mm f/4**  
  - Bridges 85mm and 135mm → could replace both in a compact package.  
  - **Sharper than you’d expect** for a zoom, very usable at portrait focal lengths.  
  - A good **alternative to carrying 85mm + 135mm primes together.**  

- **A 35–105mm f/3.5**  
  - Spans from wide-normal to medium telephoto.  
  - Effectively covers 35, 50, 85, and 100mm in one lens.  
  - **Closest to a prime replacement** (“stack of primes” nickname is well earned).  
  - Only your 28mm and 135mm primes stand outside its range.  

- **A 70–210mm f/4**  
  - Extends beyond your 135mm prime, useful for extra reach.  
  - Does **not replace** your faster 85mm for portraits or 135mm for compact sharpness.  
  - Best as a **supplement** if you need wildlife/sports coverage.

## Summary

- **Zooms as Replacements:**  
  - *A 35–105mm f/3.5* → can replace 35/50/85mm primes in many cases.  
  - *M 75–150mm f/4* → can replace 85mm + 135mm primes for travel.  

- **Zooms as Complements:**  
  - *K 35–70mm f/2.8–3.5* → complements primes, but doesn’t outperform them.  
  - *A 70–210mm f/4* → complements primes by extending reach beyond 135mm.  

**Verdict:** Primes remain smaller, faster, and sharper.  
But the **A 35–105mm f/3.5** and **M 75–150mm f/4** are the two zooms that come closest to offering prime-level performance — making them the most useful additions to your ME Super or K-series film kit.
