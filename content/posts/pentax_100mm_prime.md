The **SMC Pentax 100mm f/2.8 (K-series)** is a compact short-telephoto prime lens introduced in 1975 alongside the first generation of Pentax K-mount cameras (K2, KX, KM).  
It replaced the earlier **Super-Multi-Coated Takumar 105mm f/2.8** (M42 mount), offering a slightly shorter focal length in the new bayonet mount system.
