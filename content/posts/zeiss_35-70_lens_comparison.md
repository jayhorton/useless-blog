## 🧳 How They Fit Into a 3-Lens Travel Kit

A typical **compact film travel kit**:  
- **Wide lens (e.g. Pentax 28mm f/3.5)** → landscapes, architecture.  
- **Normal lens (e.g. Pentax 50mm f/1.7)** → everyday street, low light.  
- **Tele/Zoom option** → one of the three lenses below.

### If you choose **Zeiss 35–70mm f/3.5–4.5**
- Acts as wide-to-short-tele coverage.  
- Could replace carrying both 35mm and 50mm primes in your kit.  
- Downsides: Not fast in low light; less reach beyond 70mm.  

### If you choose **Pentax 100mm f/2.8 K**
- Complements 28mm + 50mm nicely with a compact telephoto.  
- Great for portraits, architecture details, compressed landscapes.  
- Downsides: Fixed focal length, requires swapping more often.  

### If you choose **Pentax 35–100mm f/3.5 K**
- Could act as your main lens, covering wide-normal to tele.  
- Reduces lens swaps, works as an all-in-one solution.  
- Downsides: Large, heavy, not discreet for street or casual travel.
