## 📷 Pentax 35–100mm f/3.5 (PK)

### Key Features
- **Mount:** Pentax K  
- **Zoom Range:** 35–100mm  
- **Max Aperture:** Constant f/3.5  
- **Build:** Large, heavy, solid metal construction  
- **Weight:** ~780g  
- **Focus:** Manual focus, smooth ring  
- **Era:** Late 1970s to early 1980s  

### Strengths
- **Versatility:** Covers wide-normal (35mm) to short telephoto (100mm). Great “walkaround” range.  
- **Sharpness:** Very good center sharpness when stopped down; solid across the frame at f/5.6–f/8.  
- **Contrast & Color:** Classic Pentax SMC coatings; warm, natural rendering.  
- **Constant f/3.5:** Easier exposure consistency compared to variable-aperture zooms of the era.  

### Weaknesses
- **Weight:** Nearly 800g — heavy on compact bodies like the ME Super.  
- **Size:** Big lens; less discreet for travel or street work.  
- **Wide-end performance:** Softer edges at 35mm, especially wide open.  
- **Handling:** Long minimum focusing distance (about 1.2m). Not ideal for close-ups.
