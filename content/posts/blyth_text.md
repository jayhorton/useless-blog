# Review of R. H. Blyth’s *Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics* (1942)

## Introduction  
Reginald Horace Blyth’s *Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics*, published in 1942, occupies a curious and influential place in both Zen studies and comparative literature. Written during the Second World War—Blyth was an Englishman living in Japan, who would later spend time interned as an enemy alien before working with Japanese officials during the Allied Occupation—the book represents an early attempt to present Zen not through doctrinal exposition or monastic record, but through a lens deeply attuned to Western literary sensibilities. It is a hybrid text: part anthology, part personal reflection, part cultural critique. In its pages, Blyth seeks to demonstrate how the “Zen spirit” is not the preserve of Japanese Buddhism but an experiential reality that can be found in Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Blake, Thoreau, and even in the terse wit of Samuel Johnson.  

What results is a text that is neither systematic theology nor conventional literary criticism, but something closer to a manifesto: a passionate attempt to dissolve the artificial boundaries between East and West, religion and poetry, intellect and direct experience. The book’s charm, but also its difficulty, lies precisely in this refusal to remain in one category.  

## The Structure and Method of the Book  
Blyth’s book does not follow a linear argument. Rather, it unfolds as a mosaic of quotations, anecdotes, and aphoristic commentary. One moment he cites a haiku by Bashō, the next he turns to Wordsworth’s *Prelude*; from there, perhaps, to a parable from Chinese Zen or a fragment of Shakespearean dialogue. His prose moves in spirals rather than straight lines, enacting something like the Zen method itself: unsettling rational continuity in order to provoke a flash of intuitive recognition.  

In essence, Blyth’s method is comparative juxtaposition. He wants his readers to see Blake’s cry of “Everything that lives is holy” not merely as a Romantic excess but as resonant with the Zen realization of *suchness*. Likewise, Thoreau’s insistence on “living deliberately” at Walden Pond is made to echo Zen’s call to cut through illusion and encounter life directly. The book can thus be read as an extended demonstration that Zen is not a sectarian doctrine but a universal human insight, manifest wherever human beings break through abstraction into immediacy.  

## The Zen Spirit in Western Literature  
The most compelling sections of Blyth’s work are those where his enthusiasm reveals genuine affinities across cultures. His treatment of Wordsworth, for example, highlights how the poet’s immersion in natural landscapes dissolves the ego-self into a larger unity:  

> “To me the meanest flower that blows can give / Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.”  

Blyth seizes on such moments as instances of *satori*, not in a doctrinal sense but in the immediacy of feeling that transcends rational analysis. Similarly, in Blake’s visionary affirmations, he finds the same uncompromising directness of vision that Zen celebrates in koan literature.  

Shakespeare, too, is conscripted into this comparative project. Hamlet’s awareness of the absurdity of words, Macbeth’s confrontation with the emptiness of ambition, and Lear’s anguished cry in the storm are, for Blyth, Western dramatizations of the Zen confrontation with nothingness. Even Samuel Johnson’s laconic aphorisms, when stripped of their moralizing, are read as instances of Zen-like bluntness—“the direct blow,” as it were, that cuts through illusion.  

The book thus functions as a kind of anthology of the Zen spirit hidden in plain sight in Western classics, presented to an English-speaking audience already familiar with these texts but perhaps blind to their Zen resonances.  

## Zen and the Limits of Intellectualism  
Another persistent theme in Blyth’s book is his critique of rationalism, moralism, and systematic philosophy. He sets Zen in opposition to intellectual elaboration, arguing that the essence of Zen is precisely its immediacy: to experience reality without mediation, to cut through the verbal constructions with which the mind shields itself from life.  

This anti-rational stance is sometimes exhilarating and sometimes exasperating. On one hand, Blyth gives voice to something essential in Zen—that words, doctrines, and categories must ultimately be transcended. On the other hand, his polemic occasionally lapses into caricature: Western philosophy becomes a straw man of pedantic abstraction, while Zen alone embodies life, freedom, and authenticity. In this, Blyth inherits a Romantic tendency to oppose “life” to “reason,” and one can sense in his work the wartime context of disillusionment with Western civilization’s rationalist pretenses.  

Yet even here, the book serves an important historical role. In the early 1940s, Zen was little known outside of specialized circles in Europe or America. Blyth’s dismissal of dry scholasticism, his appeal to poetry, and his ability to present Zen as something already latent in English literature helped pave the way for the later popularization of Zen by figures like D. T. Suzuki, Alan Watts, and the Beat poets.  

## Style and Tone  
Blyth’s style is idiosyncratic, aphoristic, often impatient with scholarly decorum. He writes with the urgency of someone who wants to wake his reader from sleep, not persuade them with careful argument. At times this makes the book thrilling: the prose has the compressed energy of a Zen master’s shout. At other times, it can feel scattered, even incoherent, as if Blyth were more concerned with performance than with clarity.  

This stylistic unevenness reflects the book’s hybrid nature. It is less a work of scholarship than a series of meditative reflections. One does not read it for precise exegesis of Zen doctrine—indeed, Blyth provides almost no technical discussion of Buddhist concepts—but for the way it enacts a sensibility, a way of seeing. In this sense, the book itself is a kind of koan: frustrating, paradoxical, but potentially revelatory if one allows it to work beneath the surface.  

## Influence and Legacy  
Despite (or because of) its eccentricities, *Zen in English Literature* became an important bridge text. It was widely read among intellectuals, poets, and educators in the mid-twentieth century, and its influence can be traced in the countercultural embrace of Zen in the 1950s and 1960s. Blyth himself went on to write extensive volumes on haiku, senryu, and other forms of Japanese literature, which shaped how generations of English readers approached Japanese poetics.  

The book also raises questions still relevant in comparative literature: Can one meaningfully identify “Zen” in texts that have no historical connection to Buddhism? Does such cross-cultural reading illuminate affinities or risk distorting both traditions? Blyth’s approach was unapologetically essentialist—Zen, for him, was a universal spirit that transcended cultural and historical particularity. While contemporary scholars might critique this as romantic projection, the very boldness of his claim helped to open the field of East–West comparative studies.  

## Criticisms and Limitations  
Modern readers may find the book problematic on several counts. Blyth’s essentialism, his tendency to read Zen into every poetic gesture, can appear reductive. His dismissal of Western philosophy overlooks the diversity of traditions within it. His understanding of Zen itself, filtered through personal interpretation rather than deep scholarly engagement with Buddhist sources, risks appearing superficial.  

Moreover, his book is very much a product of its historical moment: written in wartime Japan, by an Englishman trying to reconcile cultural dislocation and existential crisis. Its polemical tone, its romanticization of Zen as an antidote to Western rationalism, reflects this context. As scholarship, the book is dated. As cultural document, however, it remains fascinating.  

## Conclusion  
R. H. Blyth’s *Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics* is less a treatise than an experience: fragmentary, polemical, uneven, but also deeply alive. It is the record of one man’s attempt to articulate, across cultural boundaries, a sensibility of immediacy and presence that he found equally in Zen Buddhism and in the great works of Western literature.  

For readers seeking systematic analysis, the book may frustrate. For those willing to read it as Blyth intended—as a series of flashes, juxtapositions, and provocations—it can still be illuminating. Its greatest value lies not in the precision of its arguments but in the way it models a mode of encounter: to read poetry, to meet life, to face suffering and joy, without the protective veil of abstraction. In that sense, Blyth’s book is itself an instance of the Zen it proclaims.
